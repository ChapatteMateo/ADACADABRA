The **R** **E**pidemics **Con**sortium (RECON) is an international
not-for-profit, **non-governmental organisation** gathering experts in data
science, modelling methodology, public health, and software development to
create the next generation of analytics tools for informing the response
to *disease outbreaks*, *health emergencies* and *humanitarian crises*, 
using the [R software](https://www.r-project.org/) and other free, 
open-source resources.

This includes packages specifically designed for handling, visualising, and
analysing outbreak data using cutting-edge statistical methods, as well as more
general-purpose tools for data cleaning, versioning, and encryption, and system
infrastructure.

Our packages must fulfil three key aspects:

- *Efficiency*: our tools can be used in real time to improve situation
  awareness and inform intervention strategies.

- *Reliability*: our tools are thoroughly and constantly tested using
  professional software development methods.

- *Accessibility*: our tools are free, open-source, and available on virtually
  any platform; they can be used with different levels of expertise, and aim to
  provide graphical user interfaces implementing the most important
  functionalities.
